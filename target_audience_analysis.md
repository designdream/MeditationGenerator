2. **Female-Dominated Market**: With women representing approximately 16% of regular meditators compared to 12% of men, there is a clear opportunity to design an experience that specifically addresses the needs and preferences of female users.

3. **Premium Positioning**: With 60% of Headspace users having household assets exceeding $99,999, there is evidence that the target audience has the financial means and willingness to pay for premium wellness solutions.

4. **Voice and Sound Preferences**: Current market research shows limited options for users to select different voice guides and customize background sounds, representing a key differentiation opportunity.

5. **Cross-Platform Integration**: There is growing demand for meditation tools that integrate with other wellness platforms and devices, particularly among the tech-savvy upper-income demographic.
